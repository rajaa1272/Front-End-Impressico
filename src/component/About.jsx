                     <h3>What They Don't Tell You About Entrepreneurship</h3>
                     <p className='text-muted'>Ed Catmull, the author of Creativity Inc., was also a computer scientist who invented the technology behind Pixar, the same company that created the hit series "Toy Story". You may not have known this bit of trivia, but Pixar technology was created in 1974, and it would take 21 years for the company to reach substantial success beginning with "Toy Story". If it weren't for Steve Jobs acquiring Pixar in 1986, we would not be able to enjoy today's cartoon animation technology because Pixar would not have existed.</p>
                    <p className='text-muted'>Catmull's story is ultimately about the perseverance it takes to overcome the struggles to achieve and maintain success. As an entrepreneur, it was not surprising to hear him say that still today, Pixar continues to face unprecedented challenges.</p>

You'll be led to believe that their success was due to their smarts and perhaps a little luck.</p>
